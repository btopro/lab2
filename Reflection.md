In Lab 2, we talked about using Git for version control and how to commit changes to Github. This is a very important topic to know as Git and Github are very common in this day and age. We learned in Lab 2 how to use several git commands like git clone, git push, git commit, and git pull. Additionally we learned about pull requests which are very usefull in version control.

For me this lab was partially a review of something I had done before in my internship. Throughout the summer I used git for committing code to my team's repository. An example of the process I used was that I had a copy of the main branch downloaded locally. I would then do work on the code that was within that repository and then go through the process of committing and pushing. On the website where I had my version of the main branch, my commit would show up there and require a merge to enter the main branch. That would be where the pull request would come into play as I would create the request and have my boss review the changes. If they were good then I would be approved to merge the changes. The one thing I will say that was different here however is that in this lab we used the main Github website which I did not use at my internship. When I was there we used a different repository website, but the process was the same however for the pull requests. Regardless this is a good process to know as it is both commonly used and very good for managing changes.
