# My Reflection / Blog (Pull Requests & Gitflow)
---
This week we talked about Gitflow, which is an extremely important topic in software development and definitely a popular one topday. I was fortunate to practice Gitflow over this past summer during an internship I had but we used a different product suite (not GitHub). The procedures were very similar to the ones used within GitHubs web application.

Here is a link I found helpful relating to those subjects: https://blog.axosoft.com/pull-requests-gitflow/

And below is the link to my video which does a **decent** job at explaining those subjects:

## Markdown, what is it?
---
Markdown is a text-to-html lightweight language that allows extremly easy conversion of plain text to html. By using special characters a non-programmer (or programmer) can easily generate a fully marked up page without writing HTML. Instead, like I am doing right now, they can simply write plain text and then by use of a few special characters, have that text fully marked up. 

Below is a list of some things that I enjoy about Markdown, while using a markdown  to list them
1. Very easy to use
2. Very easy to understand
3. Very easy to teach or inform others about

I found a Markdown Cheat Sheet via this link: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
