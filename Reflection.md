# My Reflection
### Lab 2 - Henry Pearce

Lab 2 consisted of us working with GitHub. At my internship this summer, I gained experience working with Git throguh BitBucket, and also got to work a little bit with GitHub. Because of this I still found the exercises this week helpful for learning more about Git and GitHub, especially when it came to forks and pull requests. 

In my screencast, I demostrate how to do a pull request. In the video, I working with a repository from my personal account that I fork over to *future-push*. The repository is for a simple python script that grants Amazon Web Services users temporary security credentials that they can use through the AWS CLI. This was a project I worked on during my internship, and I was given permission to make it open source. In the video, I fix some intentional errors in the README for the repository and then submit a pull request.
