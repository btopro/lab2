Git is a version control software while Github is a web service that can edit git file and do more social connection and communication on coding. I think Github is very useful in the version updated and social coding. When we make changes on the file, we usually need to created a new files. So with more and more changes and updates, there are more and more files, which is very confusing and hard to keep track of the changes. Github sovle this problem. Github can easily keep track of the changes and also invites others to work together in a project. The fork and pull request can enable other users to duplicate your work in their account and do changes without changing your original content. This allows the code to be shared and wide spread. When others found bugs on your code, they can first edit them in their account, then pull a request to let you know where they think the bug is. Then the writer can see where's the change and decide whether or not to take the advice. This is a efficient and friendly way to communicate with others and do the group coding.  

Thanks.
