# My Reflection / Blog
For Lab 2, I talked about what pull requests are on Github. Pull requests let other contributors know what you have changed when you push it to a branch in the repository. I used the Github Help website to give a visual and resource for others to look at if they need help with pull requests or other tools. In the video, I demonstrated how to do a pull request with issue 4 on the assignment page where I added a proper description of the IST 402 course. 

Overall, I think Github is an easy way for multiple people to contribute and I also find it interesting that you can promote your files on this website to try to get more people to look at your work. I am pleased that I am learning how to use this website because it could help me in my future career. I am looking forward to learning more and excited to see what else I can do on this website.
