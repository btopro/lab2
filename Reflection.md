Hello Everyone, 
This week I have been able to learn a lot about GitHUb, its many uses and benefits. When I was reading and understanding more about it, I thought it is important for one to understand what a Git is before understand the use of GitHub.Git is a version control system. Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.

So now understanding the Hub aspect - Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

While I was working with GitHUb and completing some tasks, I understood that its a fantastic platform for collaboration.People can edit the files, make new branches and let other collaborators in the team know about the same by creating Pull Request. When you look at the Screencast below, you will understand that "pull request" feature is a really helpful feature. It basically allows you to let other collaborators know of any changes you have made and why it was neccessary.  I think with this feature, peer review is easier, it reduces conflict , there is continuous delivery and clear ownership of responsibility.
