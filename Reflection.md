# My Reflection / Blog

*Screencast submission* - [ZL's Lab2 Video](https://youtu.be/cMdzLb08Q1I)

In this week's lab, we learned about version control, and to be more specific, how to use `git`, including `clone`, `push`, `pull` features, and how to make a *Pull Request*. This is a very useful tool since teamwork is a key element of software development at present and GitHub is the most popular platform where all these collaborations happen.

It is also very interesting to see how Pull Request functions being very handy while a lot of people still don't know. I was trying to figure out such function during my summer internship and GitHub's own documentation on this was not clear at all (at least to me, blah). So I think it's probably a good idea for me to make a video on this as well and hopefully this can help someone who's in need to learn this and couldn't figure out from the documentation.

And for the purpose of practicing `markdown`, refer below for the terminal commands I used in my video:

<pre>
> git clone <i>link to your repository</i> 
</pre>

<pre>
> cd <i>directory location of your local repository</i> 
</pre>

<pre>
> vim README.md
</pre>

<pre>
> git status
</pre>

<pre>
> git add .
</pre>

<pre>
> git commit -m "<i>commitment message</i>"
</pre>

<pre>
> git push
</pre>

<pre>
> git pull
</pre>
