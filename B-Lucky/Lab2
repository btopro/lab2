GitHub is an open source version control system that is great for keeping track of updates and changes made to code. These changes are
stored in repositories. Here developers can work on editing code together. Anyone can contribute to these and try to make them better. A
repository or "repo" is used to store different versions of files for projects. These all have a unique url. To edit different files, you
need to "fork" the repo. This allows you to create your own version of the project that you are contributing to. This encourages more
people to try and edit different code. After new projects are updated you can also update your own fork of that project fairly easily. Now
after you have forked a repository and made some edits you can issue a "pull request". This is how you can get recognition from the
original creator and maybe even have your edits put into the original version!

Another cool thing with GitHub is markdown! Markdown is an easy to read and write syntax that formats plain text. Some simple examples of
markdown are using * * to wrap around a word to *italicize* that word. Another is using ** ** to wrap a word which will **bold** your text. 

For my video I chose to record my screen while issuing a pull request. I gave step-by-step instructions on how to fork the repo, make
edits, and then issue a pull request. This was not my first-time using GitHub but it was my first time getting the chance to edit anything
on it. It was a pretty fun learning how to do it all and I am looking forward to playing around with it more in the future.
