Lab 2 is all about Github and pull request. 
Github is a cloud-based service website that support web developers store and manage their code in order to track and control all changes happening in code. 
There is a very important step in Github. Which is pull request. 
Pull request is kind of storage of Github. It stores all changes to discuss about those changes and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the base branch. 
Users are able to be recognized by the original developers by creating a pull request. Because the original developers can see all users work, and choose whether or not to accept it into the official project. 
Github is very useful to those web developers and beginners who are doing web control and collaboration. 
I hope I will get used of Github well, so I can do web design more professionally and creativity.
