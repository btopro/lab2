# FILL THINGS OUT BELOW THIS LINE AND DO IT IN MARKDOWN

## Working definition of Git and what it's done for

> Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

Long story short, Git is a collaborative platform, somewhat like the Google Doc (not working exactly the same way though), specifically designed for programmers.

> It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

## What do you think the top 3 reasons to use GitHub / GitLab are?
1. Collaborate with other programmers within the team
2. Contribute to open source softwares
3. Safe for development as `git` keeps track of all file history

## What is a Pull Request?

Pull Request is a mechanism for you to take part in other people's code, usually a repo that you don't have push privilege to. It allows you to change some line(s) of codes in the repo, having discussion with the owner of the repo, and raising up potential issues etc.
