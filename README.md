Git is a version control system designed to manage changes made in codebases. 
## What do you think the top 3 reasons to use GitHub / GitLab are?
1. Interface that is similar with other enterprise software (word editors, file managers) that makes it easy for non developers to learn quickly
2. Community focused, popular with open source projects
3. Variety of tools (example: cloning with http link), Atom text editor, other resources 

## What is a Pull Request?
Pull request starts conversation with repo owner to show your changes and get comments.
